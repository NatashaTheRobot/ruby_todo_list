This is a Basic Command Line To Do App in Ruby

We’re going to create a command-line app to manage a todo list. For the first iteration, we want to support the following features.

First, users should be able to access all features via the command line. For example:

todo add Bake a delicious blueberry-glazed cheesecake
todo list
todo delete <todo-identifier>
todo complete <todo-identifier>

These are just examples. You don’t need to use the same command names, or command formats.
Requirements

A user can pass ‐‐help or ‐h to the app to see a list of available commands and their use

The TODO list must be stored in a plain-text file which is both human readable and writable.

A user can append an item to their TODO list
A user can prepend an item to their TODO list
A user can delete a specific item from their TODO list
A user can complete a specific item from their TODO list
A user can see a list of all their outstanding TODO items by creation date
A user can see a list of all their completed TODO items by completion date
We strongly encourage you to use the doctopt.rb gem to parse your command line options.
